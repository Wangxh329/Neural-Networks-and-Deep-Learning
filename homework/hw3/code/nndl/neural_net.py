class TwoLayerNet(object):
  """
  A two-layer fully-connected neural network. The net has an input dimension of
  N, a hidden layer dimension of H, and performs classification over C classes.
  We train the network with a softmax loss function and L2 regularization on the
  weight matrices. The network uses a ReLU nonlinearity after the first fully
  connected layer.

  In other words, the network has the following architecture:

  input - fully connected layer - ReLU - fully connected layer - softmax

  The outputs of the second fully-connected layer are the scores for each class.
